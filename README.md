## Working With Embeded Systems Pi 3B+
======================================
- `Linux`, `RaspberryPI`, `Python3`, `CompVision`, `Sensors`, `BreadBoard`
#### Abstract

- This repo is a backup to my journey in working with [Embeded Systems](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/embedded_systems/es_overview.htm), i.e a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system.

##### Requirents, Dependencies and Tools used
===============================================
The following are the basic requirements to fully achieve the aim of this project
- Raspberry PI, Basic knowledge in python, jumper wires, 
- Virtual Network Computer to view your pi remotely.

#### Errata.

Although I have taken every care to ensure the accuracy my our content here in,I'm human and mistakes
do happen. If you find a mistake in this project—maybe a mistake in the text or
the code—I would be grateful if you could report this to me via [mail](jaylabs2030@gmail.com) or via visiting my official [website](https://okomojacob.herokuapp.com). By doing so, you can
save others from frustration and help me improve subsequent versions of this mini-project and related works. 

#### Getting Further Help
One of the greatest benefits of Working with `Embedded Systems`, especially the [Raspberry PI](https://www.google.com/search?q=raspberry+pi&sxsrf=ALeKk01grBSMcQU0GLnDL_4y8phqHjjcPg:1614927201337&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=TJ4wJpZVMQHa7M%252CDtHoUD5AlbtMeM%252C%252Fm%252F0gmg36g&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kQfF9ip8UyewJOzkBCddE2hBXxR0Q&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYyLHRyJjvAhXGXRUIHX1HBcgQ_B16BAg7EAE#imgrc=TJ4wJpZVMQHa7M)is its great kind and helpful user community here at [Raspberry Website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
For help with any aspect of related to handling it - from installation, to application design, to
to deployment - feel free to ask questions online.
